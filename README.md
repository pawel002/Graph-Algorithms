# Graph Algorithms
Solutions to Graph Algorithms course exercises at AGH university.
## Description
Each project is written in python 3.

| LAB NUMBER  | TOPIC |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [lab1](https://github.com/pawel002/Graph-Algorithms/tree/main/lab1)  | Path with maximum minimum value using Find union  |
| [lab2](https://github.com/pawel002/Graph-Algorithms/tree/main/lab2)  | Max flow using Edmonds-Karp  |
| [lab3](https://github.com/pawel002/Graph-Algorithms/tree/main/lab3)  | Edge connectivity using stoer-wagner  |
| [lab4](https://github.com/pawel002/Graph-Algorithms/tree/main/lab4)  | Properties of chordal graphs, maxclique, vertexcover, coloring, lexbfs |

This repository also contains solutions to two project that were meant to be solved using graph algorithms.
